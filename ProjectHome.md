This is a must-have addon for all [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) fans!

[YouPlayer](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/5709) is a [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox) addon. It's a YouTube video player with a playlist similar to the one in [Winamp](http://www.winamp.com). You may add/drag a [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) link into the playlist window. When you double-click on it, it will be shown in the video window. You may drag a link to a browser window or right-click it and open in a new tab. You may also add/drag other links, thus the playlist will work as a bookmarker.

For now the https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5709 site is the official [YouPlayer](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/5709) site, although you may log issues [here](http://code.google.com/p/youplayer/issues/list).
